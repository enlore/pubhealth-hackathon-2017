        <h2>Submit a Dataset</h2>
        <p>
          Are you aware of an interesting or high value data set of benefit to the
          public? Would you like to see what happens when a bunch of nerds and
          designers hack it up and turn it into a powerful interactive tool or
          visualization?

        <h2>Submit a Project Idea</h2>
        <p>
          Do you have an idea for a public good project but lack the tech expertise or
          tech team to help realize it? Shoot us an email and we’ll talk to you about
          it. If it’s motivated by public good and can be distilled into something
          workable in 12 hours, we may be able to get you in front of the group to
          pitch the idea.
          
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that project submission doesn’t guarentee that your project will
          get worked on. Also, please understand that we focus our efforts on
          volunteer, not for profit projects that are motivated by the desire to
          improve Metro Nashville’s ability to serve its residents.

        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <h3>Not a coder?</h3>
        <p>
          Excellent! We want to invite people from all kinds of professions and
          backgrounds. Good software projects need more than coders. They need
          designers, content makers, domain experts, organizers and managers, testers,
          researchers, and more.
          
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if software is a totally foreign language to you, we'll do our best find
          a place for you and help you get involved. Come help us make good things!
          
          
        </p>
        <h3>Never been to a hackathon?</h3>
        <p>
          Great! We'd love to have you. If you're unfamiliar with the format, a hackathon
          is a day long (or two), intensive learning and building session often organized
          around a theme, like ours, transparency and feedback in government.  Our
          hackathon is constructed with a fun, cooperative atmosphere, so if you aren't
          an expert coder or you're just starting to learn design you'll be just as
          welcome as a twenty year veteran of the scene.  Check out this article on
          Medium for an introduction to hackathons.
          
        </p>
        <h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
        <p>
          We take making the Nashville Civic Hack Day a safe place for people to get
          together very seriously. Please read our code of conduct, and don't hesitate to
          contact us if you have questions, concerns, or experience any uncivilized
          behavior during the event.
          
        </p>
        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
        <p>
          We're ironing out the details of the venue, and as soon as we know what's up,
          we'll post details here.
