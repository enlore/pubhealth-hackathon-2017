            Metro and the community at large. Create interactive maps and visualizations,

          p.
            Are you aware of an interesting or high value data set of benefit to the
            public? Would you like to see what happens when a bunch of nerds and
            designers hack it up and turn it into a powerful interactive tool or
            visualization?

          p Email us at #[a(href="mailto:info@codefornashville.org?subject=Public Health Dataset") info@codefornashville.org ]

          h2.title Submit a Project Idea
          p.
            Do you have an idea for a public good project but lack the tech expertise or
            tech team to help realize it? Shoot us an email and we’ll talk to you about
            it. If it’s motivated by public good and can be distilled into something
            workable in 12 hours, we may be able to get you in front of the group to
            pitch the idea.

          p.
            Please note that project submission doesn’t guarentee that your project will
            get worked on. Also, please understand that we focus our efforts on
            volunteer, not for profit projects that are motivated by the desire to
            improve Metro Nashville’s ability to serve its residents.

          h3 Not a coder?
          p.
            Excellent! We want to invite people from all kinds of professions and
            backgrounds. Good software projects need more than coders. They need
            designers, content makers, domain experts, organizers and managers, testers,
            researchers, and more.

          p.
            Even if software is a totally foreign language to you, we'll do our best find
            a place for you and help you get involved. Come help us make good things!


          h3.title Never been to a hackathon?
          p.
            Great! We'd love to have you. If you're unfamiliar with the format, a hackathon
            is a day long (or two), intensive learning and building session often organized
            around a theme, like ours, transparency and feedback in government.  Our
            hackathon is constructed with a fun, cooperative atmosphere, so if you aren't
            an expert coder or you're just starting to learn design you'll be just as
            welcome as a twenty year veteran of the scene.  Check out this article on
            Medium for an introduction to hackathons.

          h3#coc.title Code of Conduct
          p.
            We take making the Nashville Civic Hack Day a safe place for people to get
            together very seriously. Please read our code of conduct, and don't hesitate to
            contact us if you have questions, concerns, or experience any uncivilized
            behavior during the event.
